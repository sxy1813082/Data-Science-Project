# BERT-IE
Using the code in this repository, the CrisisNLP dataset can be classified using three methods: NoExp, ExpBERT and BERT-IE.

- NoExp is a traditional transfer learning model. 
- ExpBERT was proposed by Murty et al., and uses explanations to improve performance over NoExp. 
- BERT-IE builds off ExpBERT and uses Natural Language Inference. This method was proposed as part of a Master's Thesis for a MEng Computer Science degree at the University of Bristol.

The CrisisNLP dataset used was published in the following paper:
> Muhammad Imran, Prasenjit Mitra, Carlos Castillo: Twitter as a Lifeline: Human-annotated Twitter Corpora for NLP of Crisis-related Messages. In Proceedings of the 10th Language Resources and Evaluation Conference (LREC), pp. 1638-1643. May 2016, PortoroÅ¾, Slovenia.

and ExpBERT was proposed in the following paper:
> Shikhar Murty, Pang Wei Koh, Percy Liang
>
> [ExpBERT: Representation Engineering with Natural Language Explanations]

This code has been built from code developed as part of a previous MEng Computer Science degree at the University of Bristol.
